Plagiarism Checker with TextRazor API
Introduction
This web application is a plagiarism checker powered by TextRazor API and built using Flask. It allows users to paste a block of text into a text box, which is then sent to the TextRazor API for natural language processing (NLP) analysis. The application retrieves detailed information about the entities and topics present in the text, which can be useful for identifying potential plagiarism or understanding the key components of the content.

Features
Text Analysis: The app sends the text input to the TextRazor API and retrieves detailed analysis, including entities and topics.
Plagiarism Detection: Helps analyze the text and identify key entities and topics that may assist in detecting plagiarism.
Simple User Interface: Paste your text into the input box and submit it to receive results in a clean and easy-to-understand format.
Technologies Used
Python: The programming language used to build the application.
Flask: A lightweight web framework for building the web application.
TextRazor API: An API for text analysis that helps extract meaningful data, such as entities, topics, and more, from the input text.
HTML/CSS: Basic web technologies used to create the front-end of the application.
